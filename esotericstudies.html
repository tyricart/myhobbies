    <h2>Some of my Esoteric Studies</h2>
    <p>Call me crazy (don't worry I have a link at the bottom to justify that) but I believe in and seek after the deep mysteries of creation. Quantum Theory excites me, reincarnation, soul contracts, higher frequency entities, mediums, telepathy, multiverse realities... to me are all as real as the chair I'm sitting in. Western society deems these things fictition, left to the imagination of Hollywood or the mentally ill. However there are mounds, literal pyramids in every part of the world across all ancient civilizations full of evidence of the unseen or the Essenes as I call them.  </p>

   <h2>Kabbalah</h2>
   <p>I am so grateful to have discovered <a href="https://www.kabbalah.com/">Kabbalah</a> 8 years ago. Much like my current study of Software Engineering, it's a knowledge that gets built upon little by little, year after year. I can't fully put into words how it's changed my life but I can say that I couldn't see myself without it. It's a science and an art at the same time. It's allowed me to open myself up to a whole other dimension as insane as that might sound. It's through this practice that all other aspects of my life are built upon. It's the foundational block of who I am and my connection to my creator. It's how I remind myself of why I'm here and the lense by which I see the world. </p> 
<h2>Human Design</h2>
<p>If you've never heard of Human Design before, don't worry you're not alone. I myself have only recently discovered it but what I do know is that it's a very powerful tool in navigating different areas of life.  I love the background story from Alan Krakower, its creator (if we can call him that). He himself says he was just a vessel, a conduit for the information to be received. The video I saw of him telling the story was impactful yet approachable. I'll try to summarize this complex science as follows, it combines astrology, chakras, Kabbalah, and I'Ching. If you've ever delved into any one of these topics you understand this is extremely multilayered, but like I said... don't worry. If you want to learn more visit </p>
