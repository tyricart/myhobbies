    <h2>Yacht Deliveries</h2> 
    <p>My very first yacht delivery started in Annapolis MD and ended 14 days later in Antigua. Here's a picture of me somewhere near Bermuda. Some of my favorite memories of being out at sea are the bioluminesce we saw not too far from Puerto Rico. We know we're close to land when we start to see seabirds. It's so weird to see land as a small grey line in the horizon after being in the ocean for so long. It takes a little getting used to walking on solid ground again so I hugged a tree to ground myself. But it's not all fun and games... I've been trained for emergencies and here's a picture of me in full firefighting gear in my STCW course.</p>

    <h2>Stewardess</h2>
    <p>As a stewardess in Miami Beach I've had the opportunity to cater to celebrities, professional athletes, birthday girls, bachelor parties, family reunions and everyone in between. For some people it could be their first time on a yacht, a memory that lasts a lifetime.  It's made me a better person and keeps me humble serving others knowing how I treat them can be a core memory long after they leave my presence. A big part of me is a stewardess for a selfish reason, it makes me feel good to make others happy. I hope my daughter picks up the love of the ocean and serving others.</p>
