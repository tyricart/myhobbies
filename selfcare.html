    <h3>What does self care look like for me?<h3></h3></p>
        <h6>Self care for me is three fold, connecting to my creator through grounding, connecting to myself through meditation and connecting to others by giving of  what I create. </h6>    
    <h2>Grounding</h2>
        <h6>For me, grounding is literally connecting to the earth. My goal is to find a place where there are not too many people so that only nature can exist. No matter where I am, I let my bare skin touch the dirt, grass or ocean sand. I lay down and allow my heart beat to penetrate the earth beneath me. My intention is to be recharged by its frequency. As I am surrounded by nature the sun kisses my skin, and my ears take in the sounds that greet me. I go for walks at near by trails, spend days at the beach and often burn sage at home. </h6>

    <h2>Meditation</h2>
        <h6>Meditation is also a very important practice in my self care routine. It's taken some time to learn to stop thinking and just observe. I taught myself to focus on my heart beat and where I could feel it throughout my body. For me it's very helpful to slow down my breathing so that my heart will in turn slow down as well. Once I'm relaxed it's easier to notice something that happens all the time, my heart beating in my feet lol. I started meditating in preparation for my Reiki Shihan Master course and as a result I've expanded into Kundalini and Qigong meditations.</h6>

    <h2>Creating Art</h2>
        <h6>I wasn't always an artist, I have to thank the pandemic for that. I picked up a paint brush and went big pretty much out the gate of my artist career. I've since scaled up in canvas size and currently am working on a 36"x48". Like all of my self care habits, I am very intentional and this one is probably my favorite for two reasons, I don't do it often and when I'm finished I have something tangible to appreciate. So far I've donated one large canvas and gifted five smaller canvases to my closest family membersI also started working with crystals around the same time as I started painting. I make crystal waist beads to help balance energy.</h6>
