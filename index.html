        Hello and welcome to my page. I hope to share a little bit of who I am
        and what makes me ME!

        <h3>What does self care look like for me?</h3>
        <p>
          Self care for me is three fold, connecting to my creator through
          grounding, connecting to myself through meditation and connecting to
          others by what I create.

        <h3>Can you believe I get paid to have fun?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, that's correct, I get paid to have adventures on the water. From
          cross-Atlantic yacht deliveries to day charters in Miami Beach, I get
          paid to have fun at sea.
